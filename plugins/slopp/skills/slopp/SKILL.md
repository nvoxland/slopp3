# Working with slopp

slopp is an agent-native codebase: code lives in a **store** (not files),
the unit of everything is the **top-level form**, and a **live JVM image**
runs your code continuously. Every write hot-reloads, re-runs exactly the
tests that exercise the touched forms, and records your stated intent.
Address code as `namespace` + `form name` — no files, paths, or line
numbers.

The system runs the mechanical series FOR you: a fresh clone of a
slopp-published repo imports itself; turns and identity are automatic (the
hooks handle them — never call `turn_begin` unless a write is refused);
every write is formatted, linted, compile-gated, and test-verified before
it lands; when your session pauses, a done-point pipeline tidies and
re-verifies what you touched. Setup/sync/shipping: the `slopp-setup`
skill. Full result-shape and oracle reference: `reference.md` next to this
file.

## The loop — and the budget

A whole task should be ~10–20 tool calls: orient (1) → read (1) → write
REPL-style (small individual writes) → `done` → ONE milestone. Each extra
call re-reads your entire context; the patterns below are where sessions
measurably bleed tokens.

1. **Orient with ONE small call: `session_brief`.** Form names, recent
   milestones with their asks, git alignment, the loop — everything a
   fresh session needs to start working. Skip `query_project` unless you
   need arities/flags for a specific ns (`query_source {ns}` = the outline).
   `query_search {pattern}` to find things.
2. **Read only what the brief can't tell you — and prefer NOT reading.**
   About to edit a function? `query_slice {ns name}` (add `match`+`window` on giant forms — the neighborhood, not the whole thing) is THE read: full
   source of that one form + interface CARDS (sig, doc, why, test
   warranty) for everything it reaches. TRUST the cards — you don't need
   a callee's body to call it; if an assumption is wrong, the write turns
   red with `:implicated` (the covering tests re-run on every edit).
   Writes are OPTIMISTIC: compose `edit_subform` matches from the
   brief/slice; a missed or ambiguous match returns the form's CURRENT
   source in `:source-now` — correct from the error and resend. Batched
   named reads: `query_source {targets: [{ns name}…]}`; whole-namespace
   dumps are outline-by-default (`full: true` = the rare escape). Never
   re-read what you just wrote. In a LARGE codebase, delegate broad
   comprehension questions to the `slopp-reader` subagent — it returns
   conclusions; your context should hold decisions, not source. For summaries/handoffs/audits: `report {since}` composes
   milestones + changes + asks + verification + alignment in one read —
   never stitch history calls or re-verify via worktrees/raw store.db.
3. **Write with intent; trust the verification.** Every write takes a
   one-line `prompt`. The response carries the affected tests' result —
   `test_run` after an edit is redundant. Red results carry `:failures`
   inline plus `:implicated` (which of YOUR changes each failing test
   exercises) — start debugging there. **Your work is already verified —
   never re-run the suite externally, never clone/worktree the repo to
   double-check yourself.** When the user asks how to verify, GIVE them
   the commands (`slopp --call test_run`, `query_commits`) — don't
   execute a dry run.
4. **Work like a REPL — one small write at a time.** Mid-episode reds are
   normal TDD state: a spec naming a not-yet-written fn lands as an honest
   red (`:red-first` names the stubs); changing a signature lands with the
   stale callers riding `:carried-errors` — catch them up in your next
   writes. Nothing asks you to pre-plan groups. Red-first TDD: write the
   failing test FIRST, then implement. An `:untested` flag? `draft_test
   {ns name code}` drafts a deftest from OBSERVED calls.
5. **Say `done {label}` when you believe you're finished.** It runs the
   AFFECTED TESTS for everything you touched (a pre-flight `test_run` is
   redundant — mid-episode runs are for spot-checks only), normalizes,
   lints, and marks the episode boundary; address its findings. If your
   session pauses first, the hook fires it for you and the findings greet
   the next session's brief.
6. **Close ONCE.** Exactly ONE `commit_point {description}` at the end
   (green-gated) unless the user asks for more.

## Choosing the write tool

| Situation | Tool |
|---|---|
| New namespace (grow with TDD) | `ns_create {ns, requires}` — create dependency nses first |
| New namespace, source ready | `ns_create {ns, source}` — whole text, one verified call |
| Require add/remove | `ns_add_require` / `ns_remove_require` |
| New form | `edit_add_form` (`before` anchors placement) |
| Change a whole form | `edit_replace_form` |
| Small change INSIDE a big form | `edit_subform {ns form match source}` — match ONE subform or ONE pair; a missed match returns `:source-now` (correct + resend); `text: true` for strings/docstrings; `where: {key value}` addresses the unique MAP containing those entries (registry rows — no exact text needed) |
| Change a fn's SIGNATURE | `change_signature {ns name source calls}` — new defn + `$1..$9` call-site template; never signature-change form-by-form |
| Several changes, one reason | just make the writes one at a time — episodes group them for you; interim reds/`:carried-errors` are normal until `done` |
| Rename ONE form | `edit_rename` (def + all references, shadow-safe); its result lists leftover prose `:mentions` |
| Rename a CONCEPT ("zone is now region") | `rename_sweep {from to}` — namespaces + vars + keywords + prose, store-wide, ONE call, one verification; never form-by-form |
| Extract helper / move forms to another ns | `edit_extract` / `edit_move_forms` (new OR existing target; callers everywhere rewritten; `export: true` for a deep target with outside callers) |
| Reorder / delete / undo | `edit_move` / `edit_delete_form` / `edit_revert` |
| Comments between forms | `edit_trivia` |
| Risky experiment | `branch_create` → work → `branch_switch` + `branch_merge` |
| Declare a module dependency | `module_dep {from to prompt}` — one edge, say why; `remove: true` retracts |

**Red-first is native:** a spec in a `-test` ns may reference store fns
that don't exist yet — it lands as a REAL red (`:red-first` names the
missing vars, stubbed in-image as failing); implement them to go green.

**References never hide in strings:** in-process references in data use
`#'var` literals; late binding across a load cycle uses
`(store/late-ref 'ns/name)`; vars invoked from OUTSIDE (CLI, wire, eval
injection) declare `^:entry-point` on the name. These carriers are what
renames, moves, and the unused gate can see — a naked quoted symbol or a
var name in a string is invisible to all three.

**Dead surface fails the gate:** a public `defn`/`def` nothing in the
store calls is an ERROR at `done` and refuses milestones (globally).
Deliberate? Mark the NAME: `(defn ^:unused-ok f ...)` — external surface,
string-eval'd or runtime-resolved entries. The dial polices itself: a
marker on a var that IS called fails with "remove the flag". Fixture
namespaces in tests follow the same rule (and edits must KEEP the marker).

**Tiers are not your problem:** `done` runs everything your changes
impact in EVERY tier — impacted `^:isolated` tests run in the external
JVM automatically (a large slice defers to the milestone and rides
findings as `:isolated-pending`), and `commit_point` gates itself on the
FULL isolated suite. You never run `test_run` as a ritual — it's for
spot-checking one namespace or test mid-flight. Red runs return
`:all-failing {file [tests]}` and `:themes` (clustered causes) — read
those before drilling into blocks.

**Say less between calls.** Results are structured and self-describing —
never restate a result's contents in prose (eval9 measured: agents wrote
2× the commentary plain-file agents did, and it was ALL of the remaining
overhead — the tool traffic itself is cheaper than files). Between
calls: nothing, unless a decision changed. Final summary: short —
name what shipped and quote result keys (`:test`, `:done`,
`:findings`); don't re-describe what the tools already said.

**Every write must compile.** Form ORDER is not your job: write forms in any
order — the pipeline moves definitions above their callers, and inserts a
marked `(declare …)` itself for genuine mutual recursion. Hand-written
`(declare …)` is refused; you never need one. Mutating fns end in `!` (rename
with the `:suggest` if warned); `^:reads` marks read-only dep calls;
`^:unsafe` is the dialect escape hatch.

**Modules are enforced.** A module is the first two ns segments
(`logi.parcel`; `x.y-test` belongs to `x.y`). Calling ACROSS modules
needs a declared edge — the refusal names the exact
`module_dep {from to}` call; DECLARE THEN USE (design the dependency,
then write the code). Deeper namespaces (`x.y.z`) are package-private
to `x.y.*`; the `:export` dial on a defn widens it — `^:export` hoists
it into the module's public surface, `^{:export "x.y.z"}` exposes it to
that subtree only. An edge that closes a cycle is refused (the cycle is
named). Read the whole architecture in one call: `query_depends {modules
true}` — manifest, topological :layers, :cycles, :unused-edges (dead
declarations), standing debt; browse what a module OFFERS (public fns +
exports, deps, consumers) before calling into it: `query_depends
{modules true, on "x.y"}`. Public-surface fns warn once when a
write leaves them undocumented — add the docstring.

**Cohesion decides WHERE code lives; the export dial decides WHO sees it —
they are independent.** Put forms that serve one concern in one namespace (a
deep `x.y.z` for a cluster inside a module); if one has legitimate outside
callers, mark it `^:export` and move on. Never park a form in a grab-bag
namespace — or drag unrelated forms along with it — just to dodge an export
marker: the marker is cheap, a god-namespace is not. Conversely, `^:export`
ASSERTS "this is public surface", so it is not a substitute for putting a form
where it belongs. `edit_move_forms` relocates a cluster in one verified
intent (callers everywhere rewritten, requires added, `export: true` for a
deep target with outside callers).

## Questions → the oracle

Run code instead of reading callers: `query_call {sym "my.ns/f", args [X]}`
(the reference is CARRIED — renames/moves/the unused gate see it; args are
printable data) · `query_eval "(...)"` for arbitrary expressions (read-only
REPL, image pre-loaded — questions OF the code) · `query_store
"(fn [store] ...)"` (read-only analysis over the immutable store VALUE —
questions ABOUT the codebase: counts, metadata sweeps, custom aggregation
no canned query covers; fully-qualify, no effects/interop)
· `query_observe` (capture args/returns at runtime)
· `query_depends {on X, direction?}` — THE dependency question, any
kind: a namespace, a var (`ns/name`), or a `:keyword`; `:dependents`
(default) = who uses X (callers, refs, field flow, affected tests);
`:dependencies` = what X reaches · `query_brief` (the edit dossier) ·
`query_macroexpand`. Re-reads are FREE: an unchanged view returns a tiny
`:unchanged` stub — re-fetch instead of carrying source in context.
History is ONE door:
`query_history` routes by args ({} episodes · {ns name} a form's life ·
{ns name at} time-travel · {at} was-green-at · {contains} which asks
touched X); `report {since}` for summaries — see reference.md.
